    <p>Hi! My name is Emma and I am a current third-year at Northeastern University 
      studying <span>Computer Science and Business</span>. On campus I'm involved in Women in Tech, 
      where I am the <span>Outreach Chair</span>, and UNICEF, where I serve as <span>Secretary</span>. Through 
      personal projects and coursework I have gained exposure to <span class="span-color">Java, Python, SQL, R, and HTML / CSS</span> 
      , the last of which I learned after deciding to make a personal website. 
      In terms of job experience, this past summer I was an <span>Investment Banking Summer Analyst</span> 
      at Morgan Stanley, this fall I worked as a <span>Data Science Co-op</span> at an insurance firm, and 
      this summer I will be interning at Citi as a <span>SWE</span>. In my free time I love: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Playing tennis</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Spending time in the kitchen</li>
    </ul>
